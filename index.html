            <p>
                I’m pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Information Systems with a minor in Computer Science at Brigham Young University. I currently have a 3.99 GPA, I am on a full-tuition academic scholarship, and I am on the Dean's List for the Marriott School of Business. I plan on graduating in 2019.

I’m passionate about developing websites and mobile applications, learning new technologies and programming languages, and solving business-related problems with technology. Additionally, I currently serve as a Vice President of BYU Developer's Club.

Besides my passion for technology, I am also passionate about helping others. For example, I currently serve as a computer science and business tutor for other students at BYU.

Outside of academia, I love rock climbing, whitewater rafting, hiking, attending concerts, and travelling.
